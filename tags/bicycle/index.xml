      <description>This is the first in a series of posts, where I intend to document my small restoration project: Project Armadillo.
Project Armadillo is a 70s Peugeot road bicycle which was handed to me by a friend in trust, who again had it from a friend who realised they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to enjoy it anymore. So it came into my hands after some years (I guess) of rest and therefore - and due to its age - needs some work.</description>
