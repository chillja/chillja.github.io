      <description>This post is solely for documentation and will be updated continuously. It will hold pictures, measurements and bits of knowledge that I found on the way and would rather not forget.
Measurements on old French bicycles from the 70s (and before and after) can differ all over the bike from the standards that were around that time and today. You can find a lot of information on this in the infamous archives of Sheldon Brown.</description>

      <description>After having introduced the project in the first post of this series, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to take you along my efforts to accurately identify the bike. The bike was handed to me 3rd hand without that information - and let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, who really remembers the detailed bike model and year of a bike you bought 40 years ago?1
There are a number of things we can go by:
 Decals Parts Accessories  Year After some aimless research2 on the internet I first came across an interesting post in a forum (web archive).</description>

      <description>This is the first in a series of posts, where I intend to document my small restoration project: Project Armadillo.
Project Armadillo is a 70s Peugeot road bicycle which was handed to me by a friend in trust, who again had it from a friend who realised they didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time to enjoy it anymore. So it came into my hands after some years (I guess) of rest and therefore - and due to its age - needs some work.</description>
